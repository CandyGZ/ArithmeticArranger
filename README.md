# ArithmeticArranger
proyect for FreeCodeCamp


The file arithmetic_arranger contains the basic needs of the project,
The arithmetic_arrangerVWork file is a more complete version, this makes use of zip and maps instead of just joining characters, however, if you try this, will not pass the tests of FreeCodeCamp
so just use it as an example or exercise.
on file ***VWork there's part of the code for condition True i just copy-paste to reuse for the False condition, it works, but needs some code cleaning to don't repeat some lines :)
